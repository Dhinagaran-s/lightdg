    Establishing a Connection
        Description: Verify that the server can successfully establish a TCP connection. This can be done by initiating a connection to the server's IP and port and checking for a successful handshake.

    Data Transmission Accuracy
        Description: Test the server's ability to accurately send and receive data over the TCP connection. Send a predefined set of data to the server and verify that the server receives and processes it correctly, and vice versa.

    Handling Concurrent Connections
        Description: Assess how well the server handles multiple simultaneous TCP connections. This involves opening several connections at once and ensuring the server can manage them without dropping or mixing up data.

    Connection Timeout Handling
        Description: Test how the server handles idle connections. Establish a connection and then remain idle for longer than the server’s timeout setting to ensure the server properly closes the connection.

    Error Handling in Connection
        Description: Simulate various error conditions (like network interruptions, corrupted data packets, etc.) to verify that the server handles these gracefully, without crashing or hanging.

    TCP Keep-Alive Functionality
        Description: If the server supports TCP Keep-Alive, test to ensure that it keeps the connection active during periods of inactivity as expected.

    Connection Closure
        Description: Check the server’s ability to close a TCP connection properly. This includes ensuring that resources are freed, and no memory leaks occur upon connection termination.

    Port Reusability
        Description: After the server is stopped, ensure that the TCP port it was using can be immediately reused. This verifies that the server is not leaving the port in a TIME_WAIT state.

    Handling of Malformed Requests
        Description: Test the server's resilience by sending malformed or unexpected data over the TCP connection and observe how it handles such scenarios.

    Performance under Load
        Description: Evaluate the performance of the server under high TCP load, focusing on metrics like response time, throughput, and error rate.

    Security Testing
        Description: Conduct security-related tests, such as attempting to establish unauthorized connections, to ensure the server is secure against common TCP-based attacks.
