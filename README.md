## Overview

Lightbug is a simple and sweet HTTP framework for Mojo that builds on best practice from systems programming, such as the Golang [FastHTTP](https://github.com/valyala/fasthttp/) and Rust [may_minihttp](https://github.com/Xudong-Huang/may_minihttp/). 

This is not production ready yet. We're aiming to keep up with new developments in Mojo, but it might take some time to get to a point when this is safe to use in real-world applications.

Lightbug currently has the following features:
 - [x] Pure Mojo networking! No dependencies on Python by default
 - [x] TCP-based server and client implementation
 - [x] Assign your own custom handler to a route
 - [x] Craft HTTP requests and responses with built-in primitives
 - [x] Everything is fully typed, with no `def` functions used

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

The only hard dependencies for `lightbug_http` are Mojo and [Git](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/getting-started-with-git). 
Learn how to get up and running with Mojo on the [Modular website](https://www.modular.com/max/mojo). The Docker installation was removed with the changes in Modular CLI. It will be available once Modular provides needed functionality for Docker setups.

Once you have Mojo set up locally,

1. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/saviorand/lightbug_http.git
   ```
2. Switch to the project directory:
   ```sh
   cd lightbug_http
   ```
   then run:
   ```sh
   magic run mojo lightbug.üî•
   ```
   
   Open `localhost:8080` in your browser. You should see a welcome screen. 
   
   Congrats ü•≥ You're using Lightbug!
2. Add your handler in `lightbug.üî•` by passing a struct that satisfies the following trait:
   ```mojo
   trait HTTPService:
    fn func(self, req: HTTPRequest) raises -> HTTPResponse:
        ...
   ```
   For example, to make a `Printer` service that simply prints the request to console:
   ```mojo
   from lightbug_http.http import HTTPService, HTTPRequest, HTTPResponse, OK
   from lightbug_http.strings import to_string

   @value
   struct Printer(HTTPService):
      fn func(self, req: HTTPRequest) raises -> HTTPResponse:
         var body = req.body_raw
         print(to_string(body))

         return OK(body)
   ```
   Routing is not in scope for this library, but you can easily set up routes yourself:
   ```mojo
   from lightbug_http.http import HTTPService, HTTPRequest, HTTPResponse, OK
   from lightbug_http.strings import to_string

   @value
   struct ExampleRouter(HTTPService):
      fn func(self, req: HTTPRequest) raises -> HTTPResponse:
         var body = req.body_raw
         var uri = req.uri()

         if uri.path() == "/":
               print("I'm on the index path!")
         if uri.path() == "/first":
               print("I'm on /first!")
         elif uri.path() == "/second":
               print("I'm on /second!")
         elif uri.path() == "/echo":
               print(to_string(body))

         return OK(body)
   ```
   
   We plan to add more advanced routing functionality in a future library called `lightbug_api`, see [Roadmap](#roadmap) for more details.
3. Run `magic run mojo lightbug.üî•`. This will start up a server listening on `localhost:8080`. Or, if you prefer to import the server into your own app:
   ```mojo
   from lightbug_http import *

   fn main() raises:
       var server = SysServer()
       var handler = Welcome()
       server.listen_and_serve("0.0.0.0:8080", handler)
   ```
   Feel free to change the settings in `listen_and_serve()` to serve on a particular host and port.

### Serving static files

The default welcome screen shows an example of how to serve files like images or HTML using Lightbug. Mojo has built-in `open`, `read` and `read_bytes` methods that you can use to read files from e.g. a `static` directory and serve them on a route:

```mojo
from lightbug_http.http import HTTPService, HTTPRequest, HTTPResponse, OK, NotFound
from lightbug_http.io.bytes import Bytes

@value
struct Welcome(HTTPService):
    fn func(self, req: HTTPRequest) raises -> HTTPResponse:
        var uri = req.uri()

        if uri.path() == "/":
            var html: Bytes
            with open("static/lightbug_welcome.html", "r") as f:
                html = f.read_bytes()
            return OK(html, "text/html; charset=utf-8")
        
        if uri.path() == "/logo.png":
            var image: Bytes
            with open("static/logo.png", "r") as f:
                image = f.read_bytes()
            return OK(image, "image/png")
        
        return NotFound(uri.path())
```

### Using the client

Create a file, e.g `client.mojo` with the following code. Run `magic run mojo client.mojo` to execute the request to a given URL.

```mojo
from lightbug_http.http import HTTPRequest
from lightbug_http.uri import URI
from lightbug_http.sys.client import MojoClient

fn test_request(inout client: MojoClient) raises -> None:
    var uri = URI("http://httpbin.org/status/404")
    try:
        uri.parse()
    except e:
        print("error parsing uri: " + e.__str__())

    var request = HTTPRequest(uri)
    var response = client.do(request)

    print("Status Code:", response.header.status_code())

    # print parsed headers (only selected headers are parsed for now)
    print("Content-Type:", String(response.header.content_type()))
    print("Content-Length", response.header.content_length())
    print("Server:", String(response.header.server()))
    print("Is connection set to connection-close? ", response.header.connection_close())

    # print body
    print(String(response.get_body_bytes()))
```

Pure Mojo-based client is available by default. This client is also used internally for testing the server.

## Switching between pure Mojo and Python implementations
By default, Lightbug uses the pure Mojo implementation for networking. To use Python's `socket` library instead, just import the `PythonServer` instead of the `SysServer` with the following line:
```mojo
from lightbug_http.python.server import PythonServer
```
You can then use all the regular server commands in the same way as with the default server.

<!-- ROADMAP -->
## Roadmap

<div align="center">
    <img src="static/roadmap.png" alt="Logo" width="695" height="226">
</div>

We're working on support for the following (contributors welcome!):

-  [ ] [WebSocket Support](https://github.com/saviorand/lightbug_http/pull/57)
 - [ ] [SSL/HTTPS support](https://github.com/saviorand/lightbug_http/issues/20)
 - [ ] UDP support
 - [ ] [Better error handling](https://github.com/saviorand/lightbug_http/issues/3), [improved form/multipart and JSON support](https://github.com/saviorand/lightbug_http/issues/4)
 - [ ] [Multiple simultaneous connections](https://github.com/saviorand/lightbug_http/issues/5), [parallelization and performance optimizations](https://github.com/saviorand/lightbug_http/issues/6)
 - [ ] [HTTP 2.0/3.0 support](https://github.com/saviorand/lightbug_http/issues/8)
 - [ ] [ASGI spec conformance](https://github.com/saviorand/lightbug_http/issues/17)

The plan is to get to a feature set similar to Python frameworks like [Starlette](https://github.com/encode/starlette), but with better performance.

Our vision is to develop three libraries, with `lightbug_http` (this repo) as a starting point: 
 - `lightbug_http` - HTTP infrastructure and basic API development
 - `lightbug_api` - (coming later in 2024!) Tools to make great APIs fast, with support for OpenAPI spec and domain driven design
 - `lightbug_web` - (release date TBD) Full-stack web framework for Mojo, similar to NextJS or SvelteKit

The idea is to get to a point where the entire codebase of a simple modern web application can be written in Mojo. 

We don't make any promises, though -- this is just a vision, and whether we get there or not depends on many factors, including the support of the community.


See the [open issues](https://github.com/saviorand/lightbug_http/issues) and submit your own to help drive the development of Lightbug.
