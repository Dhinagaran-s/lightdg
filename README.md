## Overview

Lightbug is a simple and sweet HTTP framework for Mojo that builds on best practice from systems programming, such as the Golang [FastHTTP](https://github.com/valyala/fasthttp/) and Rust [may_minihttp](https://github.com/Xudong-Huang/may_minihttp/). 

It currently has the following features:
 - [x] Server listen/serve on a given host/port
 - [x] Assign your own custom handler to a route


We're working on support for:
 - [ ] Better error handling (contributors welcome!)
 - [ ] Multiple simultaneous connections and parallelization


The plan is to get to a feature set similar to Python frameworks like [Starlette](https://github.com/encode/starlette), but with better performance.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

The only hard dependency is Mojo!

1. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/saviorand/mojo-web
   ```
2. Add your handler in `main.mojo` by passing a struct satisfying the following trait:
   ```mojo
   trait HTTPService:
    fn func(self, req: HTTPRequest) raises -> HTTPResponse:
        ...
   ```
   e.g. to make a service that simply prints the request to console:
   ```mojo
   @value
   struct Printer(HTTPService):
      fn func(self, req: HTTPRequest) raises -> HTTPResponse:
         let req_body = req.body_raw
         print(String(req_body))
         return HTTPResponse(
               ResponseHeader(
                  200, String("OK")._buffer, String("Content-Type: text/plain")._buffer
               ),
               req_body,
         )
   ```
