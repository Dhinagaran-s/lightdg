## Overview

Lightbug is a simple and sweet HTTP framework for Mojo that builds on best practice from systems programming, such as the Golang [FastHTTP](https://github.com/valyala/fasthttp/) and Rust [may_minihttp](https://github.com/Xudong-Huang/may_minihttp/). 

This is not production ready yet. We're aiming to keep up with new developments in Mojo, but it might take some time to get to a point when this is safe to use in real-world applications.

Lightbug currently has the following features:
 - [x] Set up a server to listen on a given host/port
 - [x] Assign your own custom handler to a route
 - [x] Craft HTTP requests and responses with built-in primitives
 - [x] Everything is fully typed, with no `def` functions used


We're working on support for the following (contributors welcome!):
 - [ ] Pure Mojo networking (while most of the code is in Mojo, we call Python's `socket` library in several parts of the code)
 - [ ] Better error handling, improved form/multipart and JSON support
 - [ ] Multiple simultaneous connections, parallelization and performance optimizations
 - [ ] WebSockets, HTTP 2.0

The test coverage is also something we're working on.

The plan is to get to a feature set similar to Python frameworks like [Starlette](https://github.com/encode/starlette), but with better performance.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

The only hard dependency for `lightbug_http` is Mojo. 
Learn how to set it up on the [Modular website](https://www.modular.com/max/mojo).

Once you have Mojo up and running on your local machine,

1. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/saviorand/mojo-web
   ```
   Alternatively, start the project in Github Codespaces for quick setup:

   [![Open in GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/codespaces/badge.svg)](https://codespaces.new/saviorand/lightbug_http)
2. Add your handler in `main.mojo` by passing a struct that satisfies the following trait:
   ```mojo
   trait HTTPService:
    fn func(self, req: HTTPRequest) raises -> HTTPResponse:
        ...
   ```
   For example, to make a `Printer` service that simply prints the request to console:
   ```mojo
   @value
   struct Printer(HTTPService):
      fn func(self, req: HTTPRequest) raises -> HTTPResponse:
         let body = req.body_raw

         print(String(body))

         return OK(body)
   ```
   Routing is not in scope for this library, but you can easily set up routes yourself:
   ```mojo
   @value
   struct ExampleRouter(HTTPService):
      fn func(self, req: HTTPRequest) raises -> HTTPResponse:
         let body = req.body_raw

         if req.uri.path() == "/":
               print("I'm on the index path!")
         if req.uri.path() == "/first":
               print("I'm on /first!")
         elif req.uri.path() == "/second":
               print("I'm on /second!")
         elif req.uri.path() == "/echo":
               print(String(body))

         return OK(body)
   ```
   We plan to add routing in a future library called `lightbug_api`, see [Roadmap](#roadmap) for more details.
3. Run `mojo main.mojo`. This will start up a server listening on `localhost:8080`. Or, if you prefer to import the server into your own app:
   ```mojo
   from lightbug_http.io.bytes import Bytes
   from lightbug_http.python.server import PythonServer
   from lightbug_http.service import Printer


   fn main() raises:
      var server = PythonServer()
      let handler = Printer()
      server.listen_and_serve("0.0.0.0:8080", handler)
   ```

   Feel free to change the settings in `listen_and_serve()` to serve on a particular host and port.

<!-- ROADMAP -->
## Roadmap

<div align="center">
    <img src="static/roadmap.png" alt="Logo" width="695" height="226">
</div>

Our vision is to develop three libraries, with `lightbug_http` (this repo) as a starting point: 
 - `lightbug_http` - HTTP infrastructure and basic API development
 - `lightbug_api` - (coming later in 2024!) Tools to make great APIs fast, with support for OpenAPI spec and domain driven design
 - `lightbug_web` - (release date TBD) Full-stack web framework for Mojo, similar to NextJS or SvelteKit

The idea is to get to a point where the entire codebase of a simple modern web application can be written in Mojo. 

We don't make any promises, though -- this is just a vision, and whether we get there or not depends on many factors, including the support of the community.


See the [open issues](https://github.com/saviorand/lightbug_http/issues) and submit your own to help drive the development of Lightbug.
